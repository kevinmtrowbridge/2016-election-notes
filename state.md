# State races

This site is quite good for the CA propositions: https://ballot.fyi


## Races

### CA State Senator (California State Senate district 11)

Jane Kim


### CA State Assembly Member (California Assembly district 17)


## Referenda

### Proposition 51 · $9 Billion Bond for modernizing K-12, charter, vocational schools and community colleges

1st pass: YES
2nd pass: ??? -- some of anti-arguments kinda make sense to me

Opponents, including Gov. Jerry Brown, oppose the prop because it adds $500M of debt every year to the budget, it seems to bank roll construction companies, and it won't go to the neediest school districts.

Folks who want it: construction companies?


### Proposition 52 · Extends existing fee on hospitals to fund coverage for Medi-Cal, uninsured patients, and children's health

1st pass: YES seems simple
2nd pass: YES still seems simple, no one really opposes it


### Proposition 53 · Requires statewide voter approval for bonds over $2 billion

1st pass: NO, I like the CA rail
2nd pass: NO even more so, "ornery, created by millionaire Delta farmer"


### Proposition 54 · Stops the legislature from passing any bill unless it's published on the internet for 72 hours

1st pass: Dunno weird.


### Proposition 55 · Extends income tax on earnings over $250,000 to fund schools and healthcare

YES YES YES


### Proposition 56 · Increases taxes on tobacco and e-cigarettes to increase funding for health care for low-income Californians

YES YES YES -- tax e-cigarette like regular cigarettes


### Proposition 57 · Allows parole consideration for nonviolent felons and allows juvenile court judges to decide whether juveniles will be prosecuted as adults

1st pass: not sure -- maybe?
2nd pass: YES, yes we are pro getting fewer people in jail


### Proposition 58 · Allows schools to establish non English-only education programs

1st pass: This is interesting ... interesting to me because of Spanish language.
2nd pass: YES, I think so, I like more local control of schools, and I like allowing more Spanish language instruction in CA.


### Proposition 59 · Recommends California propose an amendment to overturn Citizens United decision, which removed some limits for corporate and union campaign spending

1st pass: seems fine to me although Jerry Brown dislikes it
2nd pass: I don't think it's very meaningful but YES, I do think that any anti "Citizens United" is good

I think Jerry Brown is just against it, because he thinks it's silly.


### Proposition 60 · Requires adult film performers to use condoms when filming, and other health regulations

https://ballot.fyi/60/

1st pass: Maybe? Dunno seems a little complicated but, yeah maybe.
2nd pass: is it just a moralizing thing?
3rd pass: maybe it would make condoms sexy?


### Proposition 61 · Prohibits California from buying prescription drugs at a higher price than paid by the US Department of Veterans Affairs

https://ballot.fyi/61/

1st pass: Hmm?
2nd pass: YES Bernie likes it, League of Pissed Off Voters doesn't -- maybe they didn't know the details?

More research?


### Death penalty propositions

* Proposition 62 · Repeals the death penalty and replaces it with life imprisonment without possibility of parole

* Proposition 66 · Changes procedures governing state court challenges to death sentences

NO NO -- NO speeding up death penalty


### Proposition 63 · Requires background checks for purchasing ammunition and prohibits possession of large capacity magazines

YES YES -- YES make it harder to buy ammunition

"Gavin Newsom's vanity gun control proposition."

> Definitely TL;DR.
> Gun laws became super strict earlier this year in July. Prop 63 modifies those laws to make them stricter. Most of these laws don't go into effect until later, and it's possible there might be a referendum to block the new laws. 
>
> For gun owners, the largest change is the requirement to buy a permit in order to purchase ammo. It could cost up to $50 and will take time to process the request.
